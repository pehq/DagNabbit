# DAGNABBIT

it stands for... `Dungeon with Algorithmic Generator with a Nonsensical Abacus that Backstabs you with Bewildered Imaginary Tunnels`

Dagnabbit houses different formats of maps, using different functions for maximum efficiency

## Matrix
* A 2D map that is basically a tile.
* It is easy to work with but is quite inefficient to generate

## Rect
* Instead of a grid, this is a series of rectangles.
* This helps with efficiently generating the map.
* It is tough to modify values with this as a entirely new Rect map would have to be created.
